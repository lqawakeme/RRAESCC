### Development and Validation of an Artificial Neural Network-based Radiomics model for Predicting  Radiotherapy response for Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A multi-center Study

*This study aimed to establish and validate an artificial neural network-based radiomics model for the pre-treatment predicting radiotherapy response of advanced ESCC by using integrated data combined with feasible baseline characteristics of computer tomography. We collected the patients retrospectively with advanced ESCC patients who underwent baseline CT and received radiotherapy at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University as training and internal validation cohorts. And external validation cohort was conducted using independent data collected from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University. We applied the model to each cohort and compared it with other popular machine learning methods. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)  was utilized to evaluate radiomics models' performance.*
